// Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy". A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers. Example:Â 19 is a happy number 12 + 92 = 82 82 + 22 = 68 62 + 82 = 100 12 + 02 + 02 = 1 Credits: Special thanks to @mithmatt and @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
